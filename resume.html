                  <span>As the Director of Communications and Marketing at Book Hill Partners, I develop and implement all communications initiatives for the National Structured Settlements Trade Association (NSSTA). I telecommute full time, and travel to industry events and Board of Directors meetings throughout the year. I create marketing plans that include social media, targeted email campaigns, blogs, industry education and event planning. I write and submit press releases and articles for publication in news outlets, trade industry magazines and online publications to raise awareness about structured settlements. My blog posts and marketing emails are typically viewed by 50% of our membership. My biggest accomplishment in this role was overseeing a total redesign of the NSSTA website. The project included evaluating the existing site, design guidance and approval, content updates and usability testing. Since launch, web traffic has increased by 34% and we have seen a significant increase in association member login activity.</span></div>
