      <span>As the Director of Communications and Marketing at Book Hill Partners, I develop and implement all communications initiatives for the National Structured Settlements Trade Association.

My blog posts and marketing emails are typically viewed by 50% of our membership. My biggest accomplishment in this role is overseeing a total redesign of the nssta.com website. The project included evaluating the existing site, design guidance and approval, content updates and usability testing.
